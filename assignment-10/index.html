                        <strong><em>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</em></strong> is a compilation <br /> of the video games in the Mass Effect trilogy: <br />
                        Mass Effect (2007), Mass Effect 2 (2010), and Mass Effect 3 (2012). <br /> It was developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. <br />
                        All three games were remastered, with visual enhancements, <br /> technical improvements, and gameplay adjustments. <br /> Mass Effect, the first 
                        game of the trilogy, received more extensive <br /> upgrades than its counterparts, specifically with regard to graphics, <br /> combat mechanics, 
                        vehicle handling, and loading times.

                     based on video game designer Mike Pondsmith's game series. <br /> Set in a dystopian cyberpunk universe, the player <br /> assumes the role of "V"

                     from a heist gone wrong that results in <br /> an experimental cybernetic "bio-chip" containing an engram of the legendary rock star <br /> and terrorist 
                     Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) <br /> threatening to slowly overwrite V's mind; as the story progresses V and Johnny <br /> must work together 
                     to find a way to be separated and save V's life.</p>
