                <h1>First-Person Shooters</h1>
                <p>I have many fond memories of sitting around playing first person shooters with my friends. Whenever I want to get my blood flowing I will play these games!</p>
                <p>
                    A first-person shooter (FPS) is a video game centered on gun fighting and other weapon-based combat seen from a first-person perspective, with the player 
                    experiencing the action directly through the eyes of the main character. This genre falls under the action games category. Since the genre's inception, 
                    advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have proven fundamental to allow a reasonable level of immersion in the game world, and this type of games helped pushing 
                    technology progressively further, challenging hardware developers worldwide to introduce numerous innovations in the field of graphics processing units. 
                    Multiplayer gaming has been an integral part of the experience, and became even more prominent with the diffusion of internet connectivity in recent years.

                <h1>Role-Playing Games</h1>
                <p>Probably my overall favorite of the bunch; Role-Playing games allow me to imagine worlds different to my own and shape them in the ways I see fit.</p>

                    A role-playing video game, commonly referred to as a role-playing game (RPG) or computer role-playing game (CRPG), is a video game genre where the player 
                    controls the actions of a character (or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world, usually involving some form of character development 
                    by way of recording statistics. Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games and use much of the same terminology, settings, 
                    and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, 
                    complexity, as well as replay value and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs 
                    have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences.

                <h1>Strategy Games</h1>
                <p>Strategy games have probably consumed the most amount of time in my life; from trying to think on my feet to outflank an opponent to creating my civilization one turn at a time.</p>
                <p>
                    Strategy is a major video game genre that emphasizes thinking and planning over direct instant action in order to achieve victory. Although many types of 
                    video games can contain strategic elements, as a genre, strategy games are most commonly defined as those with a primary focus on high-level strategy, 
                    logistics and resource management. They are also usually divided into two main sub-categories: turn-based and real-time, but there are also many strategy 
                    cross/sub-genres that feature additional elements such as tactics, diplomacy, economics and exploration.
