                <h1>First-Person Shooters</h1>
                <p>I have many fond memories of sitting around playing first person shooters with my friends. Whenever I want to get my blood flowing I will play these games!</p>

                    A first-person shooter (FPS) is a video game centered on gun fighting and other weapon-based combat seen from a first-person perspective, with the player 
                    experiencing the action directly through the eyes of the main character. This genre falls under the action games category. Since the genre's inception, 
                    advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have proven fundamental to allow a reasonable level of immersion in the game world, and this type of games helped pushing 
                    technology progressively further, challenging hardware developers worldwide to introduce numerous innovations in the field of graphics processing units. 
                    Multiplayer gaming has been an integral part of the experience, and became even more prominent with the diffusion of internet connectivity in recent years.
