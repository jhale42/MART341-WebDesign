# This is an example of a heading

And now for a test of a paragraph. This needs to have a few sentences at least, for an adequate test. Let's see how this goes. Also **going** to test **bolds**, and *italics* using both _types_.

Testing to see if this is correctly separated.

Same here.

### Another heading example

1. Sometimes you need a list
2. Could have numbers


- Or it could be unordered
- Sometimes one might need a link to something like an image
    - [by direct link](https://github.com/jhale42/MART341-WebDesign/blob/main/assignment-1/assignmentOneScreenshot.png)
    - or with an absolute url ![assignment-1 screenshot](https://github.com/jhale42/MART341-WebDesign/blob/main/assignment-1/assignmentOneScreenshot.png

## Some code examples

`cntr = 0`

```
match index:
    case 0:
        sio.writeln('Exact Results')
        toPrint = 'Probability the sum of die is '
    case 1:
        sio.writeln('\nEmpirical Results')
        toPrint = 'Results of the sum of dice is '
    case _:
        sio.writeln('\nDifference')
        toPrint = 'Difference when sum is '
```
